## Hi there üëã

I'm **Shivani Jain**, a Passionate and results-driven Data Analyst and Software Developer with a solid foundation in leveraging data to solve complex real-world challenges. I recently completed my Master‚Äôs in Computer Applications (MCA) from VIT, where I honed my skills in data analysis, machine learning, and software development. My hands-on experience includes developing predictive models for loan approval, building hybrid machine learning architectures for flood risk assessment, and creating insightful data visualizations to drive decision-making.

I thrive on transforming raw data into actionable insights and am currently expanding my expertise into Python Full Stack Development to build end-to-end solutions. Known for my analytical mindset and problem-solving approach, I am eager to bring my technical proficiency and passion for innovation to dynamic, growth-oriented teams. Let's collaborate to make data-driven success a reality!
